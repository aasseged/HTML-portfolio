<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm looking to becoming a Full stack developer. Watching and casually scrolling on the 
  internet made me really fond of these people that create
  this websites. The different way these websites operate and can structure a way a person can think
  about whatever is on the website.

<p>Now a a little history about 
  I was born and raised in Virginia with two loving parents. I grew up in a Ethiopian immigrant household with
  one older sister, who is not in the tech world. In high school, I grew a liking in code from my cousin. He 
  was in college and chose computer science as a major, and I was curious about it so i looked it up. And what I saw,
  was confusing to me. I did research and research about it and found out what it. I put it on the backburning thinking this is my
  2nd best option if something that is more powerful of a job. So i graduate from high school and went into community college to major in 
  computer science. And as I was there, I realized that college is not for me. So i graduate college, with a lot of life probelms, with a lot of
  family and friends passing away and a low gpa. Now I am studying Full stack developing, machine learning, and data analytics all on my own 
  so I can achieve a lot more with nothing holding me back
